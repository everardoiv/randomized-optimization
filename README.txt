Code found at: https://github.com/everardoiv/randomized-optimization
----------------------------------------

This code was built on Python 3.6
The following packages are required to run the experiments:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- csv
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- mlrose-hiive

----------------------------------------

In order to run this code you will need to be using a Python 3.6 environment with the list of dependecies having been installed (pip install X).

The two datsets are included as csv files. They are: credit-card-data.csv' and 'data/output/sampled-poker-hand-data.csv'

The file structure used was the following:
- neural_network_experiment.py
- traveling_salesman.py
- credit-card-data.csv

Within traveling_salesman_problem.py, you can run the random optimization experiments.

In order to run the code you must change directories to the parent folder and run (example):
python traveling_salesman_problem.py
python neural_network_experiment.py
